# Polymer Chemistry

This is a repository with reworked polymer chemistry codes that I originally wrote for my class in polymer chemistry, and later on to help some friends in dire need.

The original codes were written in Python, but I have since picked up FORTRAN. So the new versions are helping me learn object-oriented Fortran.
