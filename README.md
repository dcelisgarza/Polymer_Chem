# Polymer Chemistry

This is a repository with two reworked codes that I originally wrote for a class in polymer chemistry. The copolymerisation program is from when I took the class myself, the 3D visualisation one I made a year later to help some friends taking the class.

The original codes were written in Python, but I have since picked up FORTRAN. So the new versions are helping me learn object-oriented Fortran. I apologise for how utterly horrendous the original codes are.
